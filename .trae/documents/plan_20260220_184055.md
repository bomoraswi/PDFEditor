I will implement the following changes to allow you to view and sign your uploaded PDF:

1.  **State Management (Vuex Store)**:
    -   Update `src/store/index.js` to store the uploaded PDF file so it can be accessed across different views.

2.  **New Editor View (`src/views/EditorView.vue`)**:
    -   Create a new view component that retrieves the file from the store.
    -   Use `pdfjs-dist` to render the PDF pages.
    -   Implement a "Sign" mode that allows you to draw a signature on top of the document using a canvas overlay.
    -   Add controls for navigation (Next/Prev page) and signature tools (Pen, Clear).

3.  **Routing**:
    -   Add a new route `/editor` in `src/router/index.js` pointing to the new `EditorView`.

4.  **Home Page Integration**:
    -   Modify `src/views/HomeView.vue` to save the uploaded file to the store and automatically redirect to the `/editor` page instead of just showing the file name.
