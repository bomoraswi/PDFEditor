I will modify the application to show options after upload instead of automatically previewing the document.

1. **Create Options View (`src/views/OptionsView.vue`)**:

   * Create a new view that displays the uploaded file name and offers actions.

   * Add buttons for:

     * **Edit/Sign PDF**: Redirects to `/editor` (existing functionality).

     * **Convert to Word**: Implements a mock conversion process (since backend is not implemented).

     * **Compress PDF**: Placeholder for future feature.

2. **Update Routing (`src/router/index.js`)**:

   * Add a new route `/options` pointing to `OptionsView.vue`.

3. **Update Home View (`src/views/HomeView.vue`)**:

   * Change the upload behavior to redirect to `/options` instead of `/editor`.

   * Ensure the file is still saved to the Vuex store before redirecting.

4. **Enhance Editor View (`src/views/EditorView.vue`)**:

   * Add a "Back to Options" button in the toolbar to allow users to return to the options screen.
